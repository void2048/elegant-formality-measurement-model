# elegant-formality-measurement-model
The training and testing datasets used in this program are generated from the corpus. The neural network training is conducted using two scripts: train.py and train(BO).py. Initially, train(BO).py employs Bayesian optimization to determine the optimal range of hyperparameters. Subsequently, train.py is used to further fine-tune these parameters to enhance model performance. The test.py script then utilizes the trained model to measure the elegant-formality.
